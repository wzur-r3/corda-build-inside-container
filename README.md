Before you start
----------------

* This PoC requires a Docker engine (of course!) and Bash shell.

TL;DR
-----

To start a shell inside a [Docker] container, just run the wrapper script:

```bash
./with-docker-container.sh
```

alternatively, to run a command inside a Docker container:

```bash
./with-docker-container.sh
```
